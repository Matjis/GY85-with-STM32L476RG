# GY85-with-STM32L476RG
GY85 sensor driver library to be used with STM32L476RG microcontroller and HAL. GY85 is nine-axis module (three-axis gyroscope + triaxial accelerometer + three-axis magnetic field)) that consists of ITG3205, ADXL345 and HMC5883L chips. It is in development and I'm working on accelerometer part right now.
